# JV8 game engine

## How to run

Install gradle and Java 22, run this command and pray that it works. I included all lwjgl stuff, so it might take a while to first start

```
gradle run
```

## Why did I make this

This was a school project, I started of writing alot of it, but then with my finals coming closer and me not having much time I used more and more ai for stuff especially in the 3d department (TD Folder). I still really enjoyed this project and completed my main goal: learning kotlin. I had to use kotlin, bcs thats what I was currently learning in school and I decidided to make this, more for fun. I do recommend making projects to learn how to write a language, but do not go overboard with your project idea. I will one day make the true JV8 in c++ and with having more time to actually learn all of these concepts properly. Its not like I totally dont understand the code, I do know what its doing, but its still alot of ai coding which I am not proud of, theres also still alot of perfomance stuff that could be done.
